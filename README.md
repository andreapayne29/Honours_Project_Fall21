Utilizing Cross-Platform Normalization on Microarray Data from Radiation-Exposed Lung Tissue Samples

Cross-Platform Normalization and DE code.R - file containing all code pertaining to cpn and de analysis

gene conversion.csv - file containing all gene orthologs

AOP_dataset.Rdata - file was too large to be uploaded. It contains the datasets from the four studies and all information can be pulled from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ using the GEO idenifiers. The identifiers can be found in the code (all start with GSE).
